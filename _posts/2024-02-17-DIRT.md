## DIRT - a Max for Live Device.
<!-- **DIRT** *is all about destruction* – in the best possible way. Crank up the distortion knob and watch as your sound transforms from pristine to pulverized in an instant. From harsh grit to downright chaos, DIRT delivers the goods with unapologetic ferocity.

But we're just getting started. Engage the reverb and watch as your obliterated audio gets swallowed by cavernous, otherworldly spaces. It's not about subtlety – it's about drowning your sound in a sea of sonic mayhem.

And let's not forget about the overdrive. This is where things go from bad to worse – in the best possible way. Push your audio to the brink of collapse with rich, saturated textures that scream for mercy.

With DIRT, there are no rules, no limits – just pure sonic destruction. Whether you're crafting industrial noise, designing apocalyptic soundscapes, or simply want to obliterate everything in your path, DIRT is your weapon of choice.

So go ahead, unleash the chaos. With DIRT by your side, the only limit is your imagination. -->
